\begin{center}\LARGE{Question (a)}\end{center}
\question{Under what conditions can one identify the causal effect of maternal smoking by comparing the unadjusted mean difference in birth weight of infants between smoking and non-smoking mothers?  Under the assumption that maternal smoking is randomly assigned, estimate its impact on birth weight.  Provide evidence for or against the assumption that maternal smoking is randomly assigned.}

\textbf{Conditions for comparing unadjusted means}\\
Let us consider a situation where maternal smoking were assigned randomly not conditional upon any other observable variables (like physical characteristics of the mother or known habits). Under this condition, we would expect the treatment and control group to be similar on all respects other than on maternal smoking habits. It may thus be reasonable to compare the unadjusted mean of the difference in birth weight of infants between smoking and non-smoking mothers to determine the causal effects of maternal smoking on infant birth weight. Therefore, the answer to the first part of the question is that we would need \uline{random assignment of maternal smoking during pregnancy that is unconditional} on any other observable variables.\\

\textbf{Estimation of impact}\\
I demonstrate the impact of maternal smoking on birthweight under assumption of random assignment of maternal smoking in two ways. Table ~\ref{a1} shows the result of a t-test on birthweight between smoking and non-smoking mothers. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference of 257.6 grams in birthweight between children born to smoking mothers and those born to non-smoking mothers.\\ Table ~\ref{a2} is the output from regressing birthweight on mother smoking status, and this suggests the same result as the t-test in Table ~\ref{a1} i.e., indicating an average drop in birthweight of 257.6 grams for smoking mothers as compared to the non-smoking mothers in the sample.\\

\end{table}

\textbf{Evidence against random assignment}

If maternal smoking were randomly assigned, then we would expect that there would be no significant differences between treatment and control on most (if not all) observable parameters of interest (in this case for the birth of the child). Intuitively, it is clear that maternal smoking during pregnancy may not be independent of the state of pregnancy (some mothers may decide to give up smoking so as to not hurt the foetus), or of socio-economic and racial characteristics of the parents. Empirically though, this may be demonstrated by comparing the mean values of various observable characteristics between the treatment and control group. Table ~\ref{a3} provides the results of t-tests on several observable variables\footnote{I am grateful to Prof. Shailender Swaminathan to have pointed out this method in class, correcting my previous misconception of looking at variable correlations as the appropriate method to determine this} between smoking and non-smoking mothers. While the list in Table ~\ref{a3} is not exhaustive on the observable characteristics, it is clear that smoking and non-smoking mothers vary distinctly on most observable characteristics. This is therefore sufficient to demonstrate that maternal smoking is \uline{not randomly assigned}. \\
