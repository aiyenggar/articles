Funk, R. J. 2014. Making the most of where you are: Geography, networks, and innovation in organizations. \textit{Academy of Management Journal}, 57(1): 193-222.\vspace{1cm}

Russell Funk argues that while geographical proximity to industry peers improves the innovation output of firms, this relationship is moderated by the efficiency of intra-firm information networks. The underlying mechanism being that diversity facilitates information processing.


\section{Theory}
Start with a summary, and then list issues numbered in order of importance.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
  \item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Empirical Methodology}
We started out attempting to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the embedded agent - institutional field engagement. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
  \item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
Summarize the results
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
  \item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Other Comments}
Summarize other comments
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Firm level fixed effects
  \item Longitudinal
  \item Time effect or a time trend
  \item Firms may self-select into locations. Are location choices exogenous?
  \item Could other firms move exogenously to the focal firm?
  \item Other firms may be guided strategically by their managers. Is there an assumption that all industry peers are required to take a similar strategic direction?
  \item Do intra-organizational information networks evolve over time? Has an assumption been made to the contrary?
  \item What is the evidence for the presence of knowledge spillovers. \cite{Arora2017a} suggest that patent citations may not be indicative of knowledge flows. It seems that Funk assumes that local spillovers take place, building on earlier work. Recent work is challenging this assumption.
  \item A lot of work, collaboration and learning happens over the Internet rather than due to physical proximity. Ask of the sample if virtual proximity matters more than physical proximity
  \item Does proximity to peer firms indeed increase the innovation outcome of firms or is it just changing the goal post (like inflation) and not particularly changing the relative standings. It is running faster to stay where you are or is it really improving outcome?
  \item Physical proximity does not imply more frequent interactions. AoM meetings maybe the only time neighbors meet.
  \item Consider the complement vs compete tension
  \item Proximity benefits may just be due to knowledge flows from common customers and common suppliers rather then from geography
  \item Participation in community clubs, children activities and other local events increases opportunities for employees of different firms to interact: What kind of conversations are likely to ensue. How likely are they to be instruments of innovation
  \item Are all firms assumed to be homogenous in all other ways? What are the implications of relaxing that assumption?
  \item Could geographically distant peer firms have other advantages, including a superior capability to sense and address local markets. Are product markets assumed to be homogenous? How about factor markets, especially the human capital market?
  \item Sample selection
  \item Alternative explanations
  \item Is it assumed that geographical proximity leads to greater alliance opportunities? Are distant firms at a necessary disadvantage while allying?
  \item Does distancing from one group of peer firms, not potentially allow for greater proximity to other firms?
  \item Funk argues that proximity allows firms to capture large volumes of knowledge through spillovers from nearby organizations. This would be incomplete without also considering absorptive capacity of recipient firms
  \item Shock or Quasi-experiment to tease out causality
  \item Questions about multi-levels
  \item Knowledge flows from proximity may help in prevention of early extinction (use the right term), rather than help improve outcomes directly
  \item Do cohesive networks naturally better off in accommodating varied views. Can highly cohesive groups tend toward herding rather than diversity?
  \item Can the relationship hypothesized in Hypothesis 2a changed in direction and still hold? Is there a simultaneity here?
  \item If links considered are of co-inventor links from successful patents, could there be a case of selecting on the dependent variable. What about all the knowledge flows that happened but did not end in co-inventor links on a successful patent application.
